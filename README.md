# project-gamemaster
A program aimed at handling GM tasks for tabletop RPGs

## Running
Create `game_data.json` (a sample is provided as `game_data.json.sample`).
Run `npm install` in the top-level directory.
Run `node index.js`.

After that's done, you can send HTTP requests to the relevant endpoints. These aren't currently documented; read the source, for now.
