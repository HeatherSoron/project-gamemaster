Note on licensing: some of the procedures and mechanics in this project are based on popular tabletop RPG rules, which are available under the Open Game License (OGL). I (Ethan) believe that this project is only using non-copyrighted parts of those rules, on the grounds that the rule text is not reproduced, and game mechanics themselves are not copyrightable. Therefore, I am licensing this solely under the MIT license (below), until/unless I add in something which is not covered by that mechanics exemption to copyright.
